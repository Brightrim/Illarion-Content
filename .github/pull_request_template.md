This template will aid you in writing your pull request.

You will need:

* To change the base branch from master to develop above this window.
* To enter a descriptive title.
* A description of your work.
* The URL for the branch you are trying to merge, e.g. https://github.com/Brightrim/Illarion-Content/tree/feature/simplified_housing
* The URL the map branch required for testing. If you didn't change the map at all, this will be https://github.com/Illarion-eV/Illarion-Map/tree/develop
* A set of SQL statements reflecting your database changes. Can be omitted if your project does not require a database change.
  For more information on how to craft these SQL statements see https://lua.illarion.org/#database-changes
* An idea of exactly what should be tested
* To create your pull request as a draft pull request, to prevent it from being merged while it is still being tested
